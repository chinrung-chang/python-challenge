# Module 3 Challenge
# Python Challenge

# Assumptions
1. no blank value for each field in the csv files

# Programming logistics
# Part 1. PyBank
1. read the budget_data.csv and skip header
2. looping and read the Profit/Losses in budget varible for each data row
3. calculate the change by deducting previous row's dollar amount from current row's
4. get Total Months, Total, Average Change, Greatest Increase in Profits and Greatest Decrease in Profits after the loop
5. put the output by line in the list: outputLines 
6. output list variable: outputLines to terminal
7. output list variable: outputLines to text file
# Part 2. PyPoll
1. read the election_data.csv and skip header
2. looping and read the votes & increment the votes in dictionary: votes_by_candidate by candidate's name
3. iterate the dictionary votes_by_candidate to calcuate the percetage and store in the dictionary: summary_by_candidate by candidate's name
4. use max function to get the highest votes from dictionary: votes_by_candidate
5. put the output by line in the list: outputLines 
6. output list variable: outputLines to terminal
7. output list variable: outputLines to text file

# Results Printed out to correctly to terminal
It can be viewed by runnning command 'py main.py' after cd to the folder contains main.py

# Exports results to text file
The text files can be found in the sub folders as describe below
1. Part 1. PyBank => analysis => output.txt 
2. Part 2. PyRoll => analysis => output.txt

# Python files
The python source code can be found in the sub folders below
